# About the Project:

An app that allows you to check how's the quality of life in the main cities of the world through some categories scores.

Besides HTML and SCSS, my goal was to build it with Vanilla Javascript only, using some ES6+ syntax and methods.

Details:

The app accept the input from the user, manages it, and send the request to the external Teleport API to get the scores and eventually display them.

More UI changes will be made in the future.
